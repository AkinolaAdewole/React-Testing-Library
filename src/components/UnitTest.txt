Unit Tests: Unit tests focus on testing individual units of code in isolation, typically at the function or component level. 
In React, this involves testing the behavior and output of components, their methods, or utility functions. 
Unit tests verify that these units of code work as expected, with specific inputs and outputs, without relying on external dependencies.
